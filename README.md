The purpose of this program is to call data from
the OpenWheatherMap API to return wheather conditions
for The Skate Bomb application

The user will be able to launch the Skate Condition application
or close the entire program

The Skate Bomb application serves as a tool for skateboards to
better plan their skate trip by checking the current whether 
conditions at the skate spot of their choosing

Once the user launches the Skate Condition window by selecting
it from the main menu, the user is then asked to input the
city name, or zip code of the location they plan to skate.
The program then returns the current wheather condition, 
temperature, and name of the city entered.
